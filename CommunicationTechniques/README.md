# üì° Web Communication Techniques vs API Protocols

Understanding the difference between **real-time communication methods** and **API protocols** is crucial when building scalable, performant web applications.

---

## üîπ Category 1: Communication Techniques / Transport Layer

These define **how data is delivered** between client and server ‚Äî whether it's request-based or event-driven.

| Technique                    | Direction                        | Description                                            | Real-Time         |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **Short Polling**            | Client ‚Üí Server repeatedly       | Periodic requests to check for updates                 | ‚ùå Fake real-time |
| **Long Polling**             | Client waits for server response | Keeps connection open until server responds            | ‚ö†Ô∏è Near real-time |
| **WebSocket**                | Bi-directional (full-duplex)     | Persistent connection, ideal for chat/gaming apps      | ‚úÖ Real-time      |
| **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** | Server ‚Üí Client (one-way)        | Real-time server updates, simple to implement          | ‚úÖ One-way        |
| **Webhook**                  | Server ‚Üí Client (URL Callback)   | Triggers external server via HTTP when an event occurs | ‚úÖ Event-driven   |

---

## üîπ Category 2: API Protocols / Data Query Layer

These define **what format and protocol** is used to request and transmit data over HTTP.

| API Protocol | Transport | Description                                   | Real-Time                 |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **REST**     | HTTP      | Stateless, resource-oriented CRUD operations  | ‚ùå                        |
| **GraphQL**  | HTTP      | Flexible queries, client chooses data shape   | ‚ùå (‚úÖ via subscriptions) |
| **gRPC**     | HTTP/2    | Contract-based (Protobuf), lightweight & fast | ‚ö†Ô∏è (Supports streams)     |

## üß† Key Differences

| Category                                       | Focus On                                    | Examples                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Transport Layer (Communication Techniques)** | Timing, connection type, real-time behavior | WebSocket, Webhook, Polling, SSE |
| **API Protocol Layer (Data Format)**           | How data is structured & queried            | REST, GraphQL, gRPC              |

---

## üîÑ Can They Work Together?

Yes! You can mix both layers to build powerful apps:

- `GraphQL + WebSocket` ‚Üí For real-time data subscriptions.
- `REST + Webhook` ‚Üí For event notifications (e.g. Stripe).
- `gRPC + Streaming` ‚Üí For efficient, real-time microservices.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Use **WebSocket, SSE, Webhook, Polling** when you care about **how/when** data is delivered.
- Use **REST, GraphQL, gRPC** when you care about **how data is structured** and **how it's queried**.

---

> üîß Example Use Case:
>
> - A real-time chat app might use **WebSockets + GraphQL Subscriptions**.
> - A payment service might use **REST APIs + Webhooks**.

### üéØ How to Explain WebSocket in an Interview

**If asked:**

> ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between WebSocket and REST/gRPC?‚Äù

You can say:

> **"REST, gRPC, and GraphQL are request-response based ‚Äî the client sends a request and gets a single response. WebSocket, on the other hand, enables full-duplex communication ‚Äî both client and server can send messages independently after the initial handshake. That makes it ideal for real-time features like chat, live notifications, or streaming updates."**

Add if needed:

> **"I used WebSocket in one of my projects for real-time updates (e.g., live notifications or collaboration tools), which REST couldn‚Äôt handle efficiently without polling."**

### üîç Summary: Comparison Table

| Protocol      | Communication                    | Real-time Capable | Use Case Examples            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **REST**      | Request-Response                 | ‚ùå No             | CRUD APIs, standard services |
| **GraphQL**   | Request-Response (flexible data) | ‚ùå No\*           | Selective data fetching      |
| **gRPC**      | Request-Response (binary)        | üö´ Partial\*      | Microservices, inter-service |
| **WebSocket** | Full-duplex                      | ‚úÖ Yes            | Chat apps, games, live feeds |

> **\*** _GraphQL has subscriptions (pseudo real-time); gRPC has streaming, but it‚Äôs not WebSocket-style real-time for browser apps._

üí° **What is a Webhook?**

A **webhook** isn‚Äôt a protocol like REST or WebSocket ‚Äî it‚Äôs an **event-driven callback mechanism** that uses HTTP to let services notify each other when certain events occur.

For example, I‚Äôve used it to receive **real-time updates** from services like **Stripe** (for payment status) or **GitHub** (for repo events).


- gRPC is an Open-Source RPC-FW that helps services to communicate efficiently, 
- with gRPC we define methods in .proto file and get auto-generated client & server code (stubs), that eliminate boilerplate code and the need for manual serialization/deserialization 
- Instead of Json over http, gRPC leverages protocol buffers to encode data i.e faster, smaller & type-safe
- gRPC uses HTTP/2 - Streams, it handles multiple requests at once that increases throughput & slashes latency.
- gRPC makes it easy to connect services written in different languages, so teams are free to choose best tool(lang's) for the job
- the End-Result a flexible FW perfect for connecting services with less overhead than REST
- if we need high-performance infrastructure for microservices, gRPC is the way to go
