        //we can fetch data from the database/server using short polling
        //this is a simple example of short polling

        const dataContainer = document.getElementById("data-container");

        async function getData() {
            try {
                const response = await fetch("/getData"); // the data get transferred on the n/w call is always the Serialized data (string format)
                const result = await response.json(); //we have to de-Serialize the data since it is in string format(serialized data)
                dataContainer.innerHTML = result.data;

                console.log(e);

       // getData();    //this is normal call, even data get updated, it will not show the updated data

       let intervalId;

       //for short polling, we can call the function every 5 seconds
        function shortPolling() {
            intervalId = setInterval(() => {
                getData();
            }, 5000);
        }        

        shortPolling();

                // there are 2-things (IMPORTANT)
        // 1. whenever we use "setInterval", make sure you are handling the ERRORS
        // 2. you should have the mechanism for closing the Interval in required cases (like)

        // (on some) Navigation or User-Action or target-Condition (in any of the cases, we have to ensure that we are clearing the Interval in required cases)

        //for to avoid un-necessary calls/polling, we have to use "clearInterval" function
